# Insurance
A risk management app in which we can create any type of risk with its own unique or common properties.
Its not fully complete yet.

I just tried to solve a problem for every risk management. Britecore told me that they give people some limited insurance. They need a system that they can create a risk and can create its own properties. Just like if they create Home insurance then they can create house adress, its owner information, height, weight and other related info. but if they give people golf insurance then house related properties are not same with golf. They need to create different properties for that.
